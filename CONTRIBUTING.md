### ‚úÖ `pre-commit` hooks

This project uses [`pre-commit`] to enforce automatic checks on commits.

You can see the config and all of the checks in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`]
file.

To install the pre-commit hook, please run `pre-commit install` from the root
of the repo. Once installed, `pre-commit` will do automatic checks on every
commit.

Note that there's also a [`pre-commit` GH Action] that will run the checks when
pushing changes or submitting PRs. For more details, check out the [`docs/`].
