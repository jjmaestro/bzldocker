# [`build-docker-images.yaml`]

Workflow to build and push Docker images from the [`Dockerfile`] in the repo.

The workflow builds the images, pushes them to the GHCR registry and links them
with the repo.

## üïπÔ∏è Triggers

The workflow is [triggered manually] via the [Actions web UI], the GH REST API
or the GH CLI tool, e.g.:

```sh
gh workflow run build-docker-images
```

When triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch` event) the workflow defaults to
"running in test mode":

* `RE_TARGET_INCLUDE` set to `^debian$` and
* `RE_TARGET_EXCLUDE` set to the same pattern as in the `push` event

This effectively limits the build targets to only the "base flavor" (the
`debian` image).

The "test run" also limits the `PLATFORMS` to `linux/amd64`, to further reduce
the time and cost of a test run.

Finally, it will build that target but **it won't tag `latest` or push any of
the image tags to the registry**.

This "test mode" behavior can be changed by setting the
`workflow_dispatch.inputs` variables: `PLATFORMS`, `RE_TARGET_INCLUDE`,
`RE_TARGET_EXCLUDE`, `TAG_DATE`, `TAG_LATEST` and `PUSH`, e.g.:

```sh
gh workflow run build-docker-images \
  -f RE_TARGET_INCLUDE=debian -f TAG_DATE=20241111
```
