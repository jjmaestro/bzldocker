Multi-platform (`amd64`, `arm64`) Bazel Docker images.

## ‚ú® Features

* Debian based
* Multi-platform: `amd64`, `arm64`
* `nonroot` user
* Bazelisk with Bazel cached
* Uses [reproducible-containers/repro-sources-list.sh] for installing packages
  from a snapshot to help [Reproducible Builds].

## üçß Image "flavors"

A "flavor" is a type of image. Flavors define variations of the base image,
layering additional tools and configurations to support different use cases.

Each image flavor corresponds to a specific [Docker named build stage] (`FROM
... AS <name>`) in the [`Dockerfile`]. Each stage builds on the previous one to
create incremental images:

* [`debian`]: the base image, with Bazelisk and Bazel installed and cached.
* [`debian-cc`]: adds `gcc` and `g++` for C/C++ toolchains.
* [`debian-debug`]: adds useful debugging and interactive tools, including
  shell enhancements like autocompletion.
* [`debian-docker`]: installs Docker, enabling workflows such as [DooD (Docker
  outside of Docker)].

## üß± Building

The images are built with the `build-docker-images` [Github Actions workflow].
The workflow builds the images, pushes them to the GHCR registry and links them
with the repo. See the [`docs/`] directory for more details.
